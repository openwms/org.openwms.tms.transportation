# Purpose
The TMS Transportation Service offers the essential functionality of the Transport Order Management (TMS) in automatic warehouses. This is 
often referred to as Material Flow Controller (MFC). Some examples are the ability to create _automated_ `TransportOrders` or to finish
already existing `TransportOrders`. Basically the service cares about the transport order management in _automated_ warehouses.
